# README for Wrapper Methods Project

Below information is from Codecademy:
> "In this project, you’ll analyze data from a survey conducted by Fabio 
> Mendoza Palechor and Alexis de la Hoz Manotas that asked people about 
> their eating habits and weight. The data was obtained from the UCI 
> Machine Learning Repository. Categorical variables were changed to
> numerical ones in order to facilitate analysis.
> 
> First, you’ll fit a logistic regression model to try to predict whether
> survey respondents are obese based on their answers to questions in the
> survey. After that, you’ll use three different wrapper methods to choose
> a smaller feature subset.
>
> You’ll use sequential forward selection, sequential backward floating 
> selection, and recursive feature elimination. After implementing each
> wrapper method, you’ll evaluate the model accuracy on the resulting 
> smaller feature subsets and compare that with the model accuracy 
> using all available features."
