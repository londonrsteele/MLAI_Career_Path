# README for Handwriting Project

The below description is from Codecademy:
> The U.S. Postal Service has been using machine learning and scanning 
> technologies since 1999. Because its postal offices have to look at
> roughly half a billion pieces of mail every day, they have done extensive
> research and developed very efficient algorithms for reading and 
> understanding addresses. And not only the post office:
> - ATMs can recognize handwritten bank checks
> - Evernote can recognize handwritten task lists
> - Expensify can recognize handwritten receipts  
> 
> But how do they do it?
> 
> In this project, you will be using **K-means clustering** (the algorithm 
> behind this magic) and scikit-learn to cluster images of handwritten digits.
