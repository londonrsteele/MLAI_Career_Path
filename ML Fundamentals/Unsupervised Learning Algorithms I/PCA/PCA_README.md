# README for PCA Project

The below description is from Codecademy:
> In this project, you will classify particles into gamma(signal) or 
> hadrons(background). Given that the features are correlated, you will perform
> PCA to get a new set of features, and select the features that contain the 
> most information. The data set was generated by a Monte Carlo program, 
> Corsika, described in D. Heck et al., CORSIKA, A Monte Carlo code to simulate
> extensive air showers, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe FZKA 6019 (1998).
>
> The first part of the project ‘Observing the Dataset’ is in script_1.py,
> with its solution in script_1_solution.py. The second part of the project 
> ‘Performing PCA’ is in script_2.py, with its solution in script_2_solution.py.
> It is highly recommend that you complete the project on your own without 
> checking the solutions, but feel free to take a look if you get stuck or 
> want to check your answers when you’re done!
