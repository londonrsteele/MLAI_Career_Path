# README for Sam's Surf Shop project

The following information is from Codecademy:

> Welcome to Sam’s Surf Shop! This project will exercise your knowledge of 
> errors and unit testing practices in Python. It will also give you a small
> taste of testing a full application.
>
> You’ve been hired to create a handful of tests for the shopping cart software
> at the surf shop. Once that is done, you’ll implement some improvements for
> these tests using more advanced unit testing features (skipping, 
> parameterization, and expected failures). Finally, you’ll have the 
> opportunity to fix bugs that were exposed by your tests.
>
> The shopping cart software for Sam’s Surf Shop lives inside of the file 
> called surfshop.py. Look over the files and familiarize yourself with their
> contents. Most of our work will take place in tests.py.
>
> Let’s get started!
