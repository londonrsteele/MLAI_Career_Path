# README for Predict Credit Card Fraud Project

The below information is from Codecademy:
> Credit card fraud is one of the leading causes of identify theft around the
> world. In 2018 alone, over $24 billion were stolen through fraudulent credit
> card transactions. Financial institutions employ a wide variety of different
> techniques to prevent fraud, one of the most common being Logistic Regression.
>
> In this project, you are a Data Scientist working for a credit card company. 
> You have access to a dataset (based on a synthetic financial dataset), that 
> represents a typical set of credit card transactions. transactions.csv is 
> the original dataset containing 200k transactions. For starters, we’re going 
> to be working with a small portion of this dataset, `transactions_modified.csv`,
> which contains one thousand transactions. Your task is to use Logistic 
> Regression and create a predictive model to determine if a transaction is
> fraudulent or not.
>
> Note that a `solution.py` file is loaded for you in the workspace, which 
> contains solution code for this project. We highly recommend that you
> complete the project on your own without checking the solution, but feel 
> free to take a look if you get stuck or want to check your answers when 
> you’re done!
