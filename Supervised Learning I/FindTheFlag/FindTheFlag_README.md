# README for Find the Flag! Project

Below information is from Codecademy:

> Can you guess which continent this flag comes from?  
> [flag link](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/machine-learning-engineer-career-path/reunion.png)
>
> What are some of the features that would clue you in? Maybe some of the 
> colors are good indicators. The presence or absence of certain shapes 
> could give you a hint. In this project, we’ll use decision trees to try
> to predict the continent of flags based on several of these features.
>
> We’ll explore which features are the best to use and the best way to
> create your decision tree.
